* Evolmacs — Self-Evolving Emacs Agent

Evolmacs is a next-generation Emacs extension that allows you to grow your environment dynamically — by simply describing what you want.

It generates, tests, repairs, and saves new Emacs Lisp functions for you, powered by modern LLMs.

** ✨ Features

 - Natural language function generation inside Emacs
 - Auto-validation with ERT tests
 - Auto-repair on failures
 - Organized saving into your Emacs configuration
 - Full Emacs-native implementation (uses =llm.el=)

** 🏗️ Architecture

The system is built around three core centers:

1. *Eval Gateway (evolmacs-eval.el)*: Safe execution environment for Emacs Lisp code
2. *LLM Communication (evolmacs-llm.el)*: Structured interaction with language models
3. *Test Runner (evolmacs-core.el)*: Validation and feedback loops for generated code

** 🚀 Quick Start

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(use-package evolmacs
  :ensure t
  :config
  (require 'evolmacs))
#+END_SRC

Then:

#+BEGIN_SRC
M-x evolmacs-create-function
#+END_SRC

Describe what you want!

Evolmacs will do the rest.

** 🔨 Requirements
