* Evolmacs â€” Self-Evolving Emacs Agent

Evolmacs is a next-generation Emacs extension that allows you to grow your environment dynamically â€” by simply describing what you want.

It generates, tests, repairs, and saves new Emacs Lisp functions for you, powered by modern LLMs.

** âœ¨ Features

 - Natural language function generation inside Emacs
 - Auto-validation with ERT tests
 - Auto-repair on failures
 - Organized saving into your Emacs configuration
 - Full Emacs-native implementation (uses =llm.el=)

** ðŸš€ Quick Start

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(use-package evolmacs
  :ensure t
  :config
  (require 'evolmacs))

M-x evolmacs-new
#+END_SRC

Describe what you want!

Evolmacs will do the rest.
